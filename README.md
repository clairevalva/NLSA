# NLSA

This project provides a Matlab implementation of nonlinear Laplacian spectral analysis (NLSA) and related kernel algorithms for feature extraction and prediction of observables of dynamical systems. 

## Usage

1. Clone down the project repository (`git clone https://github.com/dg227/NLSA`).
2. Launch Matlab, `cd` into the project's directory, and add `/nlsa` to the Matlab search path. This can be done by executing the command:
```matlab
addpath(genpath('nlsa'))
```
