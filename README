NLSA ALGORITHMS FOR MATLAB

This repository contains a collection of Matlab classes implementing nonlinear 
Laplacian spectral analysis (NLSA) and related kernel algorithms for analyzing
time series generated by dynamical systems. 

The distribution contains the following directories:

examples/circle:
   Example scripts for data generated by a periodic  dynamical system on the 
   circle

examples/torus:
   Example scripts for data generated by a quasiperiodic  dynamical system on 
   the torus

examples/torus:
   Example scripts for data generated by the Lorenz 63 chaotic system.  

nlsa/3rd_party
   Third-party functions 

nlsa/classes
   NLSA classes and methods

nlsa/utils
   Additional supporting functions

To install the package, put the nlsa directory in your Matlab path. This
can be done by executing the command

>> addpath(genpath('nlsa'))

from the root directory of the distribution, or by launching Matlab from a 
directory containing the startup.m file provided. 

Basic documentation is provided in the class definition files:

   classes/@nlsaModel_base/nlsaModel_base.m
   classes/@nlsaModel/nlsaModel.m
   classes/@nlsaModel_den/nlsaModel_den.m
   classes/@nlsaModel_ose/nlsaModel_ose.m

See also the README file in examples/torus.
